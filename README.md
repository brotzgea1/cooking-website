# cooking-website

I used flexbox for the layout of the website. If I had more time I would have switched it to a grid/flexbox hybrid, and I may still do so in the future.  I am using a mobile-first approach and a hamburger menu that uses javascript to collapse and open.  I'm also using javascript to verify email for my Newsletter, which takes in both name and email address. It displays either an error message or a thank you message depending on success of email validation. I also included a css card that expands and collapses back to original size on my recipes page.  The tips page includes a responsive layout, but it isn't what I would consider complete.  In the future I might add an accordion style drop-down menu for that info.  Everything is responsive on various screen sizes based off my different media queries.
