                <h4>Cast Iron Skillet:</h4>
                <p>Properly utilizing a cast iron skillet is probably the easiest way of stepping up your cook game.  It makes a huge difference in terms of both flavor and ease of cooking.  Not to mention they are incredibly easy to clean - just wipe out excess oil and debris with a towell.  Don't fotget to season it when you first get it by heating up oil in the pan with nothing else in it then remove excess oil once it cools.</p>

                <h4>Smoking Point:</h4>
                <p>What's it matter what kind of oil I use? They're all pretty much the same, right? Wrong.  Actually couldn't be further from the truth.  Not only does the type of oil change the types of, and thus degree of healthiness, of the fats you consume, they also have different smoking points. What I mean by that is, some oils burn at a lower temperature than others.  This not only imparts a burnt flavor onto your food, but has also been shown to increase the presence of harmful free-radicals in food as well as destroying important nutrients.  For example, specialty oils like flaxseed or walnut should not be heated at all.  Other oils, like canola and low-quality extra-virgin olive oil burn around 400 degrees Farenheit. This can be easily maintained by using medium heat on your stovetop.  However, other oils such as peanut and avocado have even higher smoke points that make them more suitable for high-heat cooking.  Also keep in mind the price of the oil you're using in relation to how much of it you plan on using.

                <h4>Seasoned Flour:</h4>
                <p>Anytime you're breading something in flour, even if it's just an initial dredge, it should be done with seasoned flour.  This can be as simple or complex, but I would recommend the following: 1 qt AP flour, 1/2 cup garlic powder, 1/2 cup onion powder, 1/4 cup salt, 1/4 cup pepper, 1/4 cup dried-thyme. It's amazing how something so simple can make such a big difference in your cooking. </p>
