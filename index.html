                <h2>Welcome</h2>    
                <p>Growing up in the South, I've always been a fan of food.  From fried chicken and mashed potatoes, to country-fried steak with sausage gravy, there's just something about Southern cooking that screams comfort. I’ve also trained in classical French cooking, absorbing various techniques that are applicable to just about any recipe.</p>

However, my passion for cooking still remains. Here you will learn professional cooking tips, as well as some of my favorite recipes from over the years.</p>
