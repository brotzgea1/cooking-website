            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Well, I guess it's been a long time coming. I first started cooking with my mom as a little boy, helping to make dinners for our family just about every week. She definitely helped blossom my desire for good food and passion for cooking.  After getting a little older, I would make food for my friends in high school when we would all get together.  Later, I went to culinary school where I graduated in just a year.  Afterward, I spent 8+ years working in various restaurants around Louisville, KY, including the restaurant that consistently wins best French food in the city.  Needless to say, I have honed my skills over the years and, despite the fact that I no longer work in restaurants, I am still a gifted cook who would be more than happy to share some of the lessons I have learned throughout the years.</p>
